Our code is incomplete, we have two branches the master branch and the sql_backend.

The master branch has a fully hardcoded "database" which does not interface with an sql server.
While the sql_backend branch contains an implemented back end which connects to the sql database, 
but does not have as much functionality compared with the master branch.
